                <p>emanifest is helping to modernise and improve cross-border commercial processes. When fully implemented, eManifest will require all carriers, freight forwarders, and importers to electronically transmit advance commercial information about their shipments to Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).The term ACE, which stands for Automated Commercial Atmosphere, is used by US Customs to express the ultimate goal of paperless trade in an environment of strengthened border protection. Every commercial vehicle approaching the US border must submit an ACE eManifest 1 hour before arrival. However, the notification must be electronically delivered to US Customs. STS INC offers this service to our clients 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
             <p><b>ACI  manifest:</b></p>
             <p>Pre-arrival data gathering and risk assessment will increase the CBSA's ability to detect high-risk shipments before they arrive at the border. Simultaneously, low-risk, genuine trade will be able to pass the border more quickly.</p>
             <p>Manifest improves the security and compatibility of Canada's border processes with North American and worldwide norms, which is crucial for the business community and for Canada as a whole.</p>
             <p>STS may set up your account directly with CBSA for ACI eManifest with one-time charges and make the eManifest available to our clients 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
